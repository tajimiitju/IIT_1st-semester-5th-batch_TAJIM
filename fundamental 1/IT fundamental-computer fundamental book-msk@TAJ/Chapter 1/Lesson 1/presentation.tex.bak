\section{Objectives}
\frame{
On completion of this lesson you will know:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Basic concepts of different number systems
\item	Characteristics of decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers
\item	Conversion of numbers

\end{itemize}
}
\section{Number Systems}
\frame
{In logical design, however, it is necessary to perform manipulations in the binary system of numbers because of the on-off nature of the physical devices used. The popular number systems are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Decimal
\item Binary
\item Octal
\item Hexadecimal
\end{itemize}

\section{Components of a Computer}

\frame{
A computer is used to process data and a data processing system consists of more than just machines. A computer system must contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item hardware,
\item software,
\begin{itemize}
\item System software, and
\item Application software
\end{itemize}

\item humanware
\begin{itemize}
\item A system analyst
\item A programmer
\item A computer operator
\end{itemize}

\item operational procedures.
\end{itemize}

}

\section{Characteristics of the Computers}

\frame{
\begin{itemize}
\item Speed: It is related to the volume of data processed per unit of time. Computer can work very fast.
\item Accuracy: The degree of accuracy of computer is very high and every calculation is performed with the same accuracy.
\item Diligence: A computer is free from tiredness, lack of concentration, fatigue, etc. It can work for hours without creating any error.
\item Versatility: It means the capacity to perform completely different type of work.
\item Power of Remembering: Computer has the power of storing any amount of information or data.
\item No IQ: Computer is a dumb machine and it cannot do any work without instruction from the user.
\item No Feeling: It does not have feelings or emotion, taste, knowledge and experience.
\item Storage: The Computer has an in-built memory where it can store a large amount of data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Classification of Computers}
\subsection{Classification based on purpose}

\frame{
\begin{itemize}
\item Servers
\begin{itemize}
\item File server
\item Print server
\item Database server
\end{itemize}
\item Workstations
\item Information appliances
\item Embedded computers
\end{itemize}

}


\section{Classification of Computers}
\subsection{Classification based on generation of computers}

\frame{
\begin{itemize}
\item First Generation (1940-1956): Vacuum tubes
\item Second Generation (1956-1963): Transistors
\item Third Generation (1964-1971): Integrated Circuits (ICs)
\item Fourth Generation (1971-Present) Microprocessor
\item Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond): Artificial Intelligence
\end{itemize}

}


\section{Classification of Computers}
\subsection{Classification based on Size}

\frame{
\begin{itemize}
\item Mainframe Computers: Mainframe computers are very large, often filling an entire room.
\item Minicomputers: Minicomputers are midsized computers. In size and power, minicomputers lie between workstations and mainframes.
\item Microcomputers: Microcomputers, also called personal computers (PCs), are the most common type of computers used by people today, whether in a workplace, at academic institutions or on the desk at home.
\begin{itemize}
\item Desktop computers
\item Game consoles
\item Note book Computers
\item Tablet PC
\item Smart phones, and PDAs (personal digital assistants)
\item	Programmable calculator
\item	Handheld game consoles

\end{itemize}

\item Super computers: Super computers are the fastest type of computer. They are employed for specialized applications.

\end{itemize}
